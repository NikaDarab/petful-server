## Summary

FIFO is a a pet adoption website.
The adoption process works strictly on a "First-In, First-Out" basis. The FIFO is based on the animals that came to the shelter first. You can adopt a cat, or a dog, or both, but you may only adopt the animal that came to the shelter first. In addition, people who want to adopt are also put in a Queue so they can adopt when it's their turn.
